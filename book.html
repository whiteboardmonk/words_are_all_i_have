<p class="line">It's been a while a while feels like ages<br/>Eyes have been looking been looking for you</p>
<p class="line">I knew I'd notice I'd not miss<br/>For I have been waiting been waiting for this</p>

<a name="s2"><h4 class="chapter_title">A day I won't forget</h4></a>
<p class="line">A glimmer of hope<br/>And a dash of curiosity</p>
<p class="line">A reassuring glance<br/>And a loving hug</p>
<p class="line">A peaceful sunset<br/>And a generous gesture</p>
<p class="line">A magnanimous bridge<br/>And a dreamy skyline</p>
<p class="line">A dazzling necklace<br/>And a childhood boot house</p>
<p class="line">A cacophonous beach<br/>And a tangy delicacy</p>
<p class="line">A restless sea<br/>And a balmy breeze</p>
<p class="line">A moonlit face<br/>And a twinkle in the eye</p>
<p class="line">A comforting exchange<br/>And a heartfelt confession</p>
<p class="line">A welcome pause<br/>And a connect for lifetime</p>
<p class="line">A sumptuous meal<br/>And a historic monument</p>
<p class="line">A long drive back<br/>And a coffee after midnight</p>
<p class="line">A night to remember<br/>And a day I won't forget</p>

<a name="s3"><h4 class="chapter_title">In you I see my girl</h4></a>
<p class="line">In you I see a rock star<br/>I see an opera singer</p>
<p class="line">In you I see a carefree bird<br/>I see a conscious soul</p>
<p class="line">In you I see a compulsive talker<br/>I see a absorbing listener</p>
<p class="line">In you I see a torrid lover<br/>I see a understanding partner</p>
<p class="line">In you I see a spoilt brat<br/>I see a loving mother</p>
<p class="line">In you I see a confused girl<br/>I see a woman of substance</p>
<p class="line">In you I see my fantasy<br/>I see my girl</p>

<a name="s4"><h4 class="chapter_title">To Paradise and Back</h4></a>
<p class="line">To the serene lake and<br/>the misty mountain peaks<br/>I dearly missed them<br/>all this time</p>
<p class="line">To the sound of silence and<br/>star gazing at night<br/>I am going to miss you<br/>all the time</p>
<p class="line">To the very special moments<br/>and spotting the pink butterfly<br/>I will treasure you<br/>all my life</p>
<p class="line">I am just back from<br/>a trip to paradise<br/>and now I wonder, why?</p>

<a name="s5"><h4 class="chapter_title">Belonging</h4></a>
<p class="line">Been a while,<br/>Not that I was waiting<br/>Not sure what I was searching</p>
<p class="line">If only I could describe<br/>But it wasn't something I was missing<br/>But there was indeed something amiss</p>
<p class="line">Now that I realize<br/>I was longing for you<br/>I was longing for that sense of belonging...</p>

<a name="s6"><h4 class="chapter_title">Sweet November</h4></a>
<p class="line">Into the night I wait<br/>with closed eyes I await</p>
<p class="line">A small nudge<br/>and a soft whisper<br/>Wake me up<br/>this November</p>
<p class="line">The feeling of a moist peck<br/>and your warm breath<br/>Don't let me sleep<br/>this November</p>
<p class="line">Hold me tight<br/>and caress me right<br/>Be with me<br/>this November</p>
<p class="line">It's been long<br/>and we have been longing<br/>Let's make love and<br/>remember this as sweet November</p>

<a name="s7"><h4 class="chapter_title">When I say, 'I love you'?</h4></a>
<p class="line">For some time,<br/>I would wonder<br/>What it means to me,<br/>when I say, 'I love you'?</p>
<p class="line">Is it the anticipation<br/>Is it curiosity<br/>Is it the butterflies.</p>
<p class="line">Or is it the pain,<br/>Is it the disappointment,<br/>Is it the heartbreak.</p>
<p class="line">Now with time<br/>I think, I know<br/>What it means to me,<br/>when I say, 'I love you'...</p>
<p class="line">I mean to say<br/>that I would be true<br/>Be right or wrong,<br/>but still be true, with you</p>
<p class="line">I mean to say<br/>that I really care<br/>About you, for you<br/>Now and forever</p>
<p class="line">I mean to say<br/>that I really respect<br/>What you think, What you believe<br/>Your values are also mine</p>

<a name="s8"><h4 class="chapter_title">Walk into my dreams</h4></a>
<p class="line">Walk into my dreams,<br/>with closed eyes.<br/>I shall surprise you,<br/>And hold you from behind.</p>
<p class="line">Unfold into a dance,<br/>As you open your eyes.<br/>I shall roll you back,<br/>And hold you tight.</p>
<p class="line">Whisper in my ears,<br/>It's about time.<br/>I shall hit the snooze,<br/>One more time :)</p>

<a name="s9"><h4 class="chapter_title">How you make me feel</h4></a>
<p class="line">Your thought keeps me in present,<br/>Your thought keeps me lost.<br/>At times I lose my sleep,<br/>At times I find myself.</p>
<p class="line">You make me feel loved,<br/>You make me feel missed.<br/>At times I feel apart,<br/>At times I feel very near.</p>
<p class="line">If only words could describe,<br/>How you make me feel.<br/>If only words could describe,<br/>How it feels to feel complete.</p>
<p class="line">You feel like a dream,<br/>You make me feel real.<br/>At times I don't wanna fall asleep,<br/>At times I don't wanna wake up.</p>
<p class="line">You make me feel high,<br/>You make me feel low.<br/>At times I can barely keep afloat,<br/>At times I feel I can fly.</p>
<p class="line">If only words could describe,<br/>How you make me feel.<br/>If only words could describe,<br/>How it feels to feel complete.</p>

<a name="s10"><h4 class="chapter_title">I want you by my side</h4></a>
<p class="line">I want you by my side<br/>On a quiet escape<br/>To find solace<br/>In an unknown place<br/>With you right by my side</p>
<p class="line">I want you by my side<br/>To weather through<br/>A a thunderstorm<br/>On a voyage<br/>With you right by my side</p>
<p class="line">I want you by my side<br/>To cuddle through<br/>A cold winter night<br/>With nothing in sight<br/>With you right by my side</p>
<p class="line">I want you by my side<br/>To chase<br/>A distant dream<br/>Outside our realms<br/>With you right by my side</p>

<a name="s11"><h4 class="chapter_title">I can still feel you</h4></a>
<p class="line">Shimmering sunrise, heartwarming sunsets<br/>Calm waters, chilly breeze<br/>I can still feel you<br/>With my closed eyes</p>
<p class="line">City walks, strangers and talk<br/>Some serendipity, some delight<br/>I can still feel you<br/>With my closed eyes</p>
<p class="line">Narrow lanes, princely feel<br/>Pitch dark skies, illuminated sights<br/>I can still feel you<br/>With my closed eyes</p>
<p class="line">Wandering souls, togetherness and love<br/>I can still feel you<br/>With my closed eyes</p>
